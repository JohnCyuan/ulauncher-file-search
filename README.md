This extension provides the following keywords:

- fd -> Search files and directories
- ff -> Search Files

- Press "Enter" - Open the file / folder using the default system action
- Press "Alt+Enter" - On a folder, it will open the respective folder in a Terminal window.

### Extension settings

- **Terminal Emulator** -> Sets the terminal emulator to use when opening directories.
- **Base dir** -> The base directory to start your searches. By detault, its the root folder "/" but you can set to your home directory, for example. Note, that only absolute paths are supported.
